### DAD PLAYER!


##What is this?

Dad player is supposed to be a replacement for music players because i truely dont like how there isnt any real good ones around

#but why?

Most media players dont look good, act bad, and dont function how i want them to
#when will full release happen?
probably never, im working in my free time and try and learn as i go on this, so ill try to keep iterating and add new functions

>Support is only on windows for now that is confimed, run it on anything and see what you get
