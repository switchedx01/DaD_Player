### DAD PLAYER!


## What is this?

Dad player is supposed to be a replacement for music players because I truely dont like how there isnt any real good ones around

## But why?

Most media players dont look good, act bad, and dont function how I want them to


## When will full release happen?


probably never, im working in my free time and try and learn as I go on this, so ill try to keep iterating and add new functions

>Support is only on windows for now that is confimed, run it on anything and see what you get
