#:kivy 2.1.0

# The common_widgets.kv file is loaded directly by app.py,
# so the #:include directive MUST BE REMOVED/COMMENTED OUT from here.
# e.g., DO NOT HAVE THIS LINE ACTIVE: #:include common_widgets.kv

# Import Python classes for use in KV, if needed at this root level
# #:import MainScreen dad_player.ui.screens.main_screen.MainScreen


# Define a global/root screen manager
ScreenManager:
    id: root_screen_manager
    # The MainScreen instance is added programmatically in DadPlayerApp.build()
